  m_Text: "In 2050, the HEP (Human Enhancement Program) is created. \r\nA substance
    is developed within the utmost confidentiality \r\nwith the support of the Japanese
    government. \r\nThis substance, S95, changes the genetic code, \r\nallowing the
    subject supernatural resistance, strength\r\n and speed. An S95 enhanced human
    is created, Zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 years later, the program behind S95 was discontinued
    \r\nafter several failed tests on human subjects. \r\nBionic members and organs
    have since been made \r\navailable to the public and have gained popularity. \r\nDue
    to the popularity of bionic organs and their increased\r\n resistance to injury,
    firearms become ineffective. The police \r\nbegin adapting bionic alterations,
    and turn to technologically\r\n improved melee weapons to damage any bionic enhancement\r\n
    with greater accuracy and damage. At this point arise several\r\n gangs that traffic
    and use bionic alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2057, an organization called GreyTek
    captures Zero, in order\r\n to replicate S95. Zero is held in a laboratory in
    Kyoto and put on\r\n cryogenic sleep. In 2069, results are produced and the second
    \r\nspecimen, called One, is created.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mindRays appear, mental chips
    that allow human-machine\r\n connection, giving people the ability to connect
    to the web all\r\n the time. In the course of 5 years, mindRay is made available
    \r\nto and used by a large part of the population.\r\n\r\nIn 2075, a hacker, known
    as Satoshi, gained control \r\nand influence over much of Japan's population by
    \r\ndiscovering a flaw in mindRays. They are discontinued\r\n worldwide, but Satoshi
    controls a large part of the\r\n population of Japan. He immediately protects
    critical\r\n points for the subsistence of mindRays, taking control \r\nof several
    people, and creates a rudimentary, though \r\nchaotic, system of organization,
    to manage the population\r\n he controls. Obsessed with his power, Satoshi sees
    himself\r\n as a god, and creates and forces a religion on his followers,\r\n
    securing common moral values, which benefit his controlling power. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome
    of the people who oppose Satoshi organize themselves to fight\r\n him, creating
    the Resistance. About Satoshi's leadership, more S95 \r\nenhanced specimens, Two,
    Three and Four are created.\r\n In 2080, The Resistance implements a plan to get
    Zero, \r\nbacked by the CIA, the MI6 and the European secret services,\r\n attacking
    the laboratory where it was being held. It is seen as the\r\n last hope of Japan.
    A soldier known as L, the best of the American army,\r\n is sent to extract Zero.\r\n"
